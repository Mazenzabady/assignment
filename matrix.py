# You should write a program that do: 
# 1- Find the list that contains ALL STRING and print them on the console on capital letters. 
# For example program will not do anything with first and second array. but the 3rd array contains ALL STRING.
# If an array contains string but there are other data types in array, your program will ignore it.
# So the program will print BOOK MOSH ARC PHOTO
# 2- Find the list that all of its elements are numbers.
# Then print the prime numbers that exists in the list in reverse order.
# During the test I will change the order of matrix. So your program should be able to find the proper array smartly.
# Your prgram should be smart to find the list that contain all strings and all numbers.
